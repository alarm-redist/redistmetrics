\usage{
capacity_util(plans, schools, schools_capacity, pop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{plans}{A \code{redist_plans} object or an integer matrix (n_units × n_plans)
of district labels.}

\item{schools}{An integer vector (1-based) of row indices that correspond to
school units in \code{shp}.}

\item{schools_capacity}{An integer vector of school capacities in the same order as schools.}

\item{pop}{Optional numeric vector (length n_units) of unit populations.
If \code{NULL}, attempts to infer from common column names in \code{shp}; falls back
to all ones.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{ndists * nplans}, i.e., the district-by-plan
scores flattened column-major. Use \code{by_plan()} to get one value per plan.
