`redistmetrics` is a member of the `redistverse`, which is a family of R
packages by the ALARM Project. `redistmetrics` provides the backend for
the computation of summary statistics for a redistricting plan. It
provides a more direct access point to use methods in `redist` without
requiring `redist` objects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of redistmetrics from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alarm-redist/redistmetrics")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(redistmetrics)
## basic example code
```

TODO (lots of todos! Use `redist` only for now!)
