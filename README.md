# rict

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`rict` is a member of the `redistverse`, which is a family of R packages
by the ALARM Project. `rict` provides the backend for the computation of
summary statistics for a redistricting plan. It provides a more direct
access point to use methods in `redist` without requiring `redist`
objects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rict from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alarm-redist/rict")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(rict)
## basic example code
```

TODO (lots of todos! Use `redist` only for now!)
